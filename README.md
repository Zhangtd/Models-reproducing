# Models-reproducing
Some models in AI academical papers implemented by myself.

**Things really useful are the self defined Keras layers.**
### 1. **CoA** from [Hashtag Recommendation for Multimodal Microblog Using Co-Attention Networks.](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0478.pdf) 
A hashtag recommendation model using a co-attention mechanism.

### 2. **TAB-LSTM** from [Hashtag recommendation with topical attention-based LSTM](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C16-1284). 
A hashtag recommendation model for texual content using attention mechanism and topical distribution.

### 3. **ABC (attention based convolutional)** from [Hashtag Recommendation Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/16/Papers/395.pdf).
 A hashtag recommendation model for textual content using two level (local and global) convolutional NN based attention mechanism.

### 4. **Hierarchical Co-Attention VQA** from [Hierarchical Question-Image Co-Attention for Visual Question Answering](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6202-hierarchical-question-image-co-attention-for-visual-question-answering.pdf).
 Co-Attention mechanism is proposed in this article for the first time.
