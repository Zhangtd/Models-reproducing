## Some models in AI academical papers implemented by myself.

### 1. **CoA** from [Hashtag Recommendation for Multimodal Microblog Using Co-Attention Networks.](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0478.pdf) A hashtag recommendation model using a co-attention mechanism.

### 2. **TAB-LSTM** from [Hashtag recommendation with topical attention-based LSTM](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C16-1284). A hashtag recommendation model for texual content using attention mechanism and topical distribution.

### 3. **ABC (attention based convolutional)** [Hashtag Recommendation Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/16/Papers/395.pdf). A hashtag recommendation model for textual content using two level (local and global) convolutional NN based attention mechanism.
